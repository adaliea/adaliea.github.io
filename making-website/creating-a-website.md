What is Jekyll?
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) is a static site generator designed to simplify the creation of fast, secure, and scalable websites. 
Built on Ruby, it takes your content written in Markdown or HTML, combines it with templates, and generates a static website ready for deployment. 
It is ideal for blogs, portfolios, and documentation sites. (This site is made with Jekyll!) 
Its minimalistic approach makes it a popular choice for developers who value control, performance, and simplicity.

Tips for Working with Jekyll
1. Start with one of the [Guides on the docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/#guides).
2. Utilize the _config.yml File
   The _config.yml file is your control center. Customize site-wide settings like the title, base URL, and plugins. Small tweaks here can drastically improve your site's behavior.
3. Master Front Matter
   Each page or post begins with front matterâ€”a YAML block specifying metadata like layout, title, and tags. Leverage this to manage content organization and appearance.
4. Preview Locally
   Use jekyll serve to build and preview your site locally before pushing changes. This lets you test and refine your site in a safe environment.
5. Organize Content with Collections
   Use collections to group content types beyond regular posts and pages. For example, manage portfolios, tutorials, or case studies in dedicated folders for better organization.
6. Learn by Experimenting
   Experiment with layouts, data files, and advanced Liquid logic. A Jekyll project is an excellent sandbox for learning web development concepts.
