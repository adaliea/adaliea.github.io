title: Making your own website!
---

Making your own website sounds a lot harder than it actually is.
This guide will connect you with resources to create and 
publish your first website that looks like [the website you're on](/).

I'll talk about what I've learned creating this site, some tips to help you create yours, and resources you may find helpful.

A personal website allows you to showcase your unique personality, skills, and projects in your own style. 
You can gain hands-on experience with web development technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks%$if you want$%,
and it works as a portfolio to display your work and achievements. 
You're also able to build a resilient digital identity that remains independent of social media platforms.

### Who is this Guide for?

If you've written some code, are a CS major looking to build a portfolio to showcase your skills, 
or just have an interest in tinkering with web technology, this guide is designed for you. 
Whether you're a total beginner or someone with a bit of experience, there's something here for everyone.

Getting started isn’t _hard_, and you’ll learn as you go. You don’t necessarily need to write a single line of code right away—you 
can begin with something as simple as a basic 
template%$You can have something on the internet in less than an hour$% 
and gradually build on it over time. 
The beauty of a personal website is that it evolves with you, reflecting your growth and interests.

For those learning to code, having a live website to experiment with can be an incredibly valuable tool. 
It provides a sandbox where you can freely try new things, troubleshoot issues, and gain confidence in your skills. 
Whenever inspiration strikes, you can just open an editor and dive right in, making it an excellent way to learn by doing.
