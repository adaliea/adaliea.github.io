title: Making Little Handwritten Notes on My Website!
---

I wanted to add some handwritten notes to my website %$That look like this!$%. Creating a few of these probably wouldn't be that hard.
A little bit of html and css with some svg images I created beforehand would do.

But since I like programming and don't really want to write a bunch of css and html I created a system that turns the following
markdown ish syntax into a note on my website.

`%​$This is how I write a note!$​%$My code doesn't know about code blocks so I have to use a Zero-Width-Space here so it doesn't turn this into an note!$%%`

I started this project with the following goals:

- Make creating new notes really easy
- Have them also work on mobile and small displays
- They should work automatically. I don't want to have to run extra commands to generate everything.
- Arrows should look hand-drawn (ish). I don't want every arrow to look the same. %$Getting notes to place properly in lists took a bunch of effort$%
