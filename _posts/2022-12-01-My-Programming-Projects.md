title: My Programming Projects
---

As a 20 year old, I've been programming for over a decade (yes half my life!). 
It started with little projects and games [I made on Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/vxa1527/), but has slowly evolved into larger and more complex projects,
some of which are listed below:

#### **Created a bunch of stuff for my FRC team:**
