Hey ðŸ‘‹, you probably don't know me, but if you do, it's probably from [my youtube videos](youtube.com/dacubeking)
or in relation to [my FRC team](https://github.com/FRC3476/AutoBuilder).

I'm an 18-year-old High School student from California. I love coding and everything about computers. 
I'm currently the programming lead for my [FRC team, Team 3476 - Code Orange](http://teamcodeorange.com/).

Apart from that, my hobbies include reading and playing video games (mainly Minecraft).
I'm currently reading [The Charm Offensive by Alison Cochrun](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56898248-the-charm-offensive).
